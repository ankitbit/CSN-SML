# CSN_Project_SML
This project is a part of an attempt to explore properties of languages from the perspective of quantitative linguistics. We're examining similarities and differences among different languages across the globe using homoscedasticty and non-linear regression techniques.

## Accomplished Objectives
* Creating of a processed directory of data files that contain metrices relevant for fitting a non-linear regression model. These metrices have to be "mean edge length" and "Second degree moment". 
* Preparation of a ***script for producing summary statistics*** such as ***sample size***, ***mean*** and ***standard deviation*** of ***sentence length (n) of syntactic dependency tree*** of each language and ***mean*** and ***standard deviation*** of the metric ***mean edge length*** for all sentences in a given language for each of the languages. 
* Fitting of models with pending issues for 


## Pending objectives
* Model fitting for each of the models
* Uisng aggregate and defining data filters
